This is a practice project. When someone visits a website, it’s possible they are viewing it on a phone, tablet, computer, or even a TV monitor. Because screen sizes can vary greatly across different devices, it’s important for websites to resize and reorganize their content to best fit screens of all sizes. Try to resize the browser to see the differences. :)
